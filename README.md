## Overview

This dataset represents the sales performance of various Coca-Cola beverages across different states and regions in the United States for the year 2022. Coca-Cola, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is the worldâ€™s largest beverage manufacturer and distributor, as well as one of the most iconic brands in marketing history. The focus of this report is exclusively on Coca-Cola's sales within the U.S. market during the specified period, analyzing regional variations and overall trends in beverage production and distribution.

The Drinks Manufacturing Dataset provides a comprehensive overview of beverage sales across various regions and states. This dataset encompasses sales data from multiple beverage brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Dasani Water, Fanta, Powerade, and Sprite. The data includes essential metrics such as sales amount, units sold, price per unit, and associated costs, enabling a detailed analysis of sales performance, profitability, and regional trends.


### Problem Statement

This report provides an in-depth analysis of beverage sales across various states in the United States for Coca-Cola and its associated brands. The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit margins, and sales growth, offering actionable insights into regional sales trends and profitability.

### Objective

The objective is to enable Coca-Cola to effectively monitor and analyze its sales performance across various retailers, regions, and states over the specified period. This includes tracking total sales, profits, and identifying the regions or states that generate the highest sales and profit margins.

The dataset initially lacked a 'Cost per Unit' (CPU) column. To accurately compute the total cost and profit, I conducted research using reliable online sources to determine the CPU for each beverage brand in 2022. The cost per unit identified through this research are as follows: 

* Coca-Cola & Diet Coke at $0.26 
* Dasani Water at $1.63 
* Fanta at $0.19 
* Powerade at $0.50 
* Sprite at $0.30. 

These values were then used for calculating the total cost and profits.




### Hypotheses Questions:

1. Identify which regions and states generate the highest sales in terms of total revenue and profits using the provided dataset.

2. Determine the month that yields the highest revenue and profits during the specified period.

3. Highlight the top-selling product across various regions and states throughout the period.

4. Analyze monthly sales and calculate the month-over-month sales growth for the given period.

5. Identify the retailer with the highest sales and profit generation on a monthly basis.

6. Determine the top and least performing states and regions based on revenue and profit from sales. 


for creating new column (Cost_per_unit) the following DAX expression was written;
       
        Cost per Unit = 
        SWITCH(
                TRUE(),
                [Beverage Brand] = "Coca-Cola", 0.26,
                [Beverage Brand] = "Diet Coke", 0.26,
                [Beverage Brand] = "Dasani Water", 1.63,
                [Beverage Brand] = "Fanta", 0.19,
                [Beverage Brand] = "Powerade", 0.50,
                [Beverage Brand] = "Sprite", 0.30,
                BLANK()  // Default case if no match
        )



        
-  New measure was created to find total count of retailers.

Following DAX expression was written for the count of retailers,
        
        Retailers = DISTINCTCOUNT('drinks_sales'[Retailer])[ID])
        
        
 -  New measure was created to total cost of drinks,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total cost,
 
         Total Cost = SUMX(
                drinks_sales,
                [Cost per Unit] * [Units Sold]
        )
 


 -  New measure was created to calculate total revenue of drinks across U.S.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total revenue,
 
         Total Rev = SUM(drinks_sales[SalesAmount])
    

 -  New measure was created to calculate total quantity sold,
        
        Total Qty = SUM(drinks_sales[Units Sold])

-   New measure was created to calculate total brand,

        Total Brand = DISTINCTCOUNT(drinks_sales[Beverage Brand])

-   New measure was created to calculate the profit,

        Profit = SUMX(
                drinks_sales,
                [SalesAmount] - ([Cost per Unit] * [Units Sold])
         )

-   New measure was created to calculate the profit %

        Profit % = DIVIDE(
                [Profit],
                SUM(drinks_sales[SalesAmount]),
                0
         )

-   New measure was created to calculate the profit margin,

        Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit],SUM('drinks_sales'[SalesAmount]),0)

-   New measure was created to calculate the current & previous month and quater to dates,

        Current MTD = TOTALMTD([Total Rev],DATESMTD(date_table[Date]))

        Current QTD = TOTALQTD([Total Rev],DATESQTD('date_table'[Date]))

        Previous MTD = CALCULATE([Total Rev],PREVIOUSMONTH(DATESMTD('date_table'[Date])))

        Previous QTD = CALCULATE([Total Rev],PREVIOUSQUARTER(DATESQTD('date_table'[Date])))


-   New measure was created to calculate the month over month, and month over month growth %,

        MoM = [Current MTD] - [Previous MTD]

        MoM % = DIVIDE([MoM],[Previous MTD],0)

-   New measure was created to calculate the quarter over quarter, and quarter over quarter growth %

        QoQ = [Current QTD] - [Previous QTD]

        QoQ % = DIVIDE([QoQ],[Previous QTD],0)


 -  The report was then published to Power BI Service.
